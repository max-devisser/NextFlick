// Container for Movie objects
// Getters/setters for Movie objects
// Be able to remove Movie objects
// Maybe make it an ArrayList with an overwritten .equals method to let you match movies based on only one parameter matching
// Or just a method called .matches() which has the above behavior
// Default constructor creates MovieCollection of all movies in database 
// Constructor with one Movie object creates a MovieCollection object with the one Movie, but is ready for more to be added through
//   the .add function
